# Prediction on job exist state on HPC enviroment
The aim of the project is to build a tool which can prevent a waste of computational resources preventing the execution of programmes that are likely to fail. In HPC centers, jobs are not executed at need, rather they follows a clear scheduling procedure which maximise efficiency. Further, also economic aspects should be taken into account during submission (more resources, higher cost). Therefore, during a job schedule, a set of parameters (e.g., number of cpu/gpu, quantity of memory, ecc.) must be specified in order to use the correct resources. These parameters are then used by the job scheduler to instantiate our work space. It's likely that, because a wrong configuration, a job can fail its run.
